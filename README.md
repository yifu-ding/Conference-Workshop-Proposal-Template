# Conference Workshop Proposal Template

This repository contains a simple conference workshop proposal template in `conf_workshop_template.tex`. It is based on successful proposals from previous workshops.
The file `compact_conf_workshop_template.tex` is a compact layout version; keep the main text within 2 pages when possible and place detailed content in the appendix.

To use it, upload the file to Overleaf and compile with `pdflatex`.
